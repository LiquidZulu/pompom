* installation
** build from source
The source code can be found at [[https://github.com/LiquidZulu/pompom][this]] GitHub repo. Nix tooling is provided through =default.nix= and can be accessed by running =nix-shell= after navigating to the repository on your terminal. I do not believe this step to be necessary on non-NixOS distributions, all that this does is provides [[https://alsa-project.org/wiki/Main_Page][ALSA]] which is required to compile.

When the source has been obtained the easiest way to compile is with =cargo build --release=, then add =path/to/pompom/target/release= to your [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)][PATH]]. I do not know if this software compiles on Windows, if you have any problems with doing this [[https://github.com/LiquidZulu/pompom/issues][open an issue]].

** crates.io
This software is distributed also at [[https://crates.io/crates/pompom][crates.io]], and should be able to be installed with =cargo install pompom=.

* usage
#+begin_src console
~ Â» pompom --help
Usage: pompom [OPTIONS] [WORK_DURATION] [REST_DURATION] [LONG_REST_DURATION]

Arguments:
  [WORK_DURATION]
  [REST_DURATION]
  [LONG_REST_DURATION]

Options:
  -u, --unit <UNIT>  [default: minutes] [possible values: seconds, minutes, hours]
  -h, --help         Print help
  -V, --version      Print version
#+end_src
* configuration
** default config
The following default configuration file should be generated at =$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pompom/config.toml= upon the first time running pompom:
#+begin_src toml
splash_screen_variant = "Row"
schedule = ["Work", "Rest", "Work", "Rest", "Work", "Rest", "Work", "LongRest"]

[work_duration]
Minutes = 25

[rest_duration]
Minutes = 5

[long_rest_duration]
Minutes = 30
#+end_src

** splash_screen_variant
Options for =splash_screen_variant= are provided by the =SplashScreen= enum in =src/splash_screen.rs=, they are:
+ Row
+ Stacked
+ None

Any text other than "Row" or "Stacked" will be interpreted as disabling the splash screen.

** schedule
=schedule= defines the pomodoro loop; so if you have =["Work", "Rest", "Work", "LongRest"]=, this would define a loop with a work period, followed by a rest period, followed by another work period, then a long rest before starting back at the first work. The default loop is 4 cycles of work/rest followed by a long rest. Valid periods are defined by =Period= in =src/types.rs=.

** *_duration
The =[*_duration]= variables define how long each period should take, valid units are defined by =Duration= in =src/types.rs=. So if you wanted the long rest period to be 1 hour you could achieve this with the following configuration:
#+begin_src toml
[long_rest_duration]
Minutes = 30
#+end_src
